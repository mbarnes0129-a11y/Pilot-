DigiCoach 7-Stage — FIX v2 (Battles + Store + Uploads)
======================================================

✅ What’s fixed
- Battles now run (enemy names, moves, HP bars).
- Store works (purchases apply, items usable in battle, items consume a turn).
- Stage image uploads work on iPhone (tap 🥚→👑).
- Bypass Cache button clears old files after updates.
- Assets versioned (?v=fix-v2) so you always load new code.

🕹️ How to install
1. Upload these files to your repo **root** (replace old ones):
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - app.js
   - manifest.json
   - service-worker.js
   - README.txt

2. In GitHub → Settings → Pages → choose **main / root**.

3. Open your Pages site, tap **♻️ Bypass Cache** once.

4. On iPhone → Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.

🧪 Self-test mode
Add `?autotest=1` to your site URL. It will:
- Give coins
- Auto-open store
- Buy an item
- Start a battle
- Perform 2 moves

Example:
https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo/?autotest=1
