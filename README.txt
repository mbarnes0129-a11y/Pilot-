DigiCoach 7‑Stage — FIX (Battles + Store + Uploads)
===================================================

This build directly targets the issues you hit:
- **Battle not working** → stable listeners, modal fallback, and fresh cache.
- **Image upload not working** → guaranteed user‑gesture file pickers per stage (iOS‑friendly).
- **Item shop not working** → store button wired, purchase flow confirms, inventory updates.

New utility:
- **♻️ Bypass Cache** button (header) — unregisters the service worker and reloads so you always get the latest files after a GitHub Pages update.

How to use
1) Upload these files to your **repo root** and enable GitHub Pages.
2) Open your site → tap **♻️ Bypass Cache** once after each update.
3) Tap a **stage button** (🥚→👑) to pick an image, then choose a file. You’ll see “Stage N image saved.”
4) Add/check off quests to earn coins and XP.
5) Open **🏪 Store**, buy an item, and check your inventory in the battle screen dropdown.
6) Start a battle — use **Move 1–4** or **🎒 Use Item** (items consume a turn).
